## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
I'm a student of Skillbox.

Music is a great part of my life. I'm a professional musician.
I'd worked in symphonic orchestra for at least 15 years. There were amazing years in my life.
But some time ago I understand that I want to change my lifestyle and be more then a musician.

So, I decided to study programming. Good luck to me!
